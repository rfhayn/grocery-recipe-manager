## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Data Model Updates (45 minutes)

#### **Data Migration Success**
```swift
// IngredientTemplate extension for staple migration
extension IngredientTemplate {
    static func migrateStaplesFromGroceryItems(in context: NSManagedObjectContext) {
        // Migration logic preserving existing staple data
        // Category assignments maintained during transition
        // Usage data preserved with integrity validation
    }
}
```

**Key Achievements:**
- Added IngredientTemplate.isStaple boolean property with default false
- Created comprehensive migration logic from GroceryItem.isStaple system
- Preserved all existing staple data with category assignments intact
- Validated migration success with data integrity checks

**Migration Benefits:**
- Zero data loss during system consolidation
- Category assignments maintained through migration
- Usage counts and relationships preserved
- Single entity now manages all ingredient-related data

#### **Core Data Model Enhancement**
- **Fetch Index Addition**: `byIngredientManagement` (isStaple, category, name, usageCount)
- **Property Integration**: isStaple seamlessly integrated with existing IngredientTemplate properties
- **Relationship Integrity**: All existing category and usage relationships maintained
- **Performance Optimization**: New indexes supporting efficient filtering and sorting

### Phase 2: IngredientsView Implementation (90 minutes)

#### **Unified Interface Architecture**
```swift
@FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: [
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \IngredientTemplate.isStaple, ascending: false),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \IngredientTemplate.category, ascending: true),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \IngredientTemplate.name, ascending: true)
    ],
    animation: .default
) private var ingredients: FetchedResults<IngredientTemplate>
```

**Implementation Features:**

- **Category Organization**: Ingredients grouped by category with color-coded headers
- **Search Integration**: Real-time filtering with instant visual feedback

### Phase 3: Category Management Integration (45 minutes)

#### **Direct Assignment Implementation**
```swift
// Single ingredient category assignment
func assignCategory(to ingredient: IngredientTemplate) {
    showingCategoryAssignment = true
    selectedIngredients = [ingredient]
}

// Bulk ingredient category assignment
func assignCategoryToBulk() {
    guard !selectedIngredients.isEmpty else { return }
    showingCategoryAssignment = true
}
```

**Key Features Achieved:**
