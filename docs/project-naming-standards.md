# Project Naming Standards
**Project**: Grocery & Recipe Manager iOS App  
**Version**: 3.0 - Enhanced with Quick Reference & Enforcement  
**Last Updated**: October 23, 2025  

---

## 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE CARD

**Current Active Work**: M4.1 (Settings Infrastructure Foundation)

### **Naming Format**
```
M[Major].[Component].[Task]

Examples:
M4       = Major Feature (Settings & Configuration)
M4.1     = Component (Settings Infrastructure)
M4.1.1   = Task (Core Settings Service)
```

### **Status Indicators**
| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| ✅ | **COMPLETE** | Fully implemented and validated |
| 🔄 | **ACTIVE** | Currently in development |
| 🚀 | **READY** | Ready to start implementation |
| ⏳ | **PLANNED** | Planned for future development |

### **Critical Rules**
1. **Always use full identifier**: "M4.1.1" not "Phase 1" or "Step 1"
2. **Update status in ALL docs**: current-story.md, project-index.md, roadmap.md
3. **Include descriptive name**: "M4.1.1: Core Settings Service"
4. **Maintain consistency**: Same naming everywhere, no variations

### **Non-Compliance Detection**
❌ **STOP if you see these patterns:**
- References like "Phase 3" or "Step 2" without M#.#.#
- Status icons used incorrectly or inconsistently
- New work not documented in current-story.md
- Missing updates to project-index.md after completion

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### **When Creating New Work**

1. **Identify the appropriate level:**
   - New major feature? → Create M[next number]
   - Component of existing feature? → Create M[major].[next component]
   - Task within component? → Create M[major].[component].[next task]

2. **Assign next sequential number:**
   - Check current-story.md for latest numbers used
   - Don't skip numbers
   - Don't reuse numbers

3. **Use descriptive names:**
   - Clear indication of functionality
   - Consistent with similar features
   - Avoid abbreviations unless standard

4. **Document immediately:**
   - Add to current-story.md with 🚀 READY status
   - Update project-index.md with reference
   - Create PRD if 6+ hours of work

### **When Referencing Work**

**✅ DO:**
- Use full identifier: "M4.1.2"
- Include descriptive name when helpful: "M4.1.2: Calendar View Component"
- Keep status current: READY → ACTIVE → COMPLETE
- Update all documentation when status changes

**❌ DON'T:**
- Use ambiguous references: "Phase 3", "Step 2"
- Mix naming conventions: Don't use both "M4.1" and "Phase 1"
- Reference work not documented in current-story.md
- Leave outdated status indicators

### **Documentation Updates**

**When starting work:**
1. Update current-story.md: 🚀 READY → 🔄 ACTIVE
2. Set clear completion criteria
3. Note start time for tracking

**During work:**
1. Update progress notes in current-story.md
2. Document decisions in learning notes
3. Keep status current

**When completing work:**
1. Update current-story.md: 🔄 ACTIVE → ✅ COMPLETE
2. Add actual time spent
3. Update project-index.md with completion
4. Update roadmap.md if milestone complete
5. Create/update learning notes

**Maintain consistency across:**
- current-story.md
- project-index.md
- requirements.md
- roadmap.md
- learning notes

## 📊 NAMING COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

**Before starting ANY development work:**

- [ ] Read this document (project-naming-standards.md)
- [ ] Check current-story.md for current M#.#.# identifiers
- [ ] Verify work is documented with correct naming
- [ ] Confirm status indicator is accurate
- [ ] Review project-index.md for context

**During development:**

- [ ] Use full M#.#.# identifier in all references
- [ ] Update status when changing phases (READY → ACTIVE → COMPLETE)
- [ ] Document in current-story.md using correct naming
- [ ] Use consistent naming in code comments
- [ ] Reference correct milestone in learning notes

**After completing work:**

- [ ] Mark complete (✅) in current-story.md
- [ ] Add actual time spent
- [ ] Update project-index.md
- [ ] Update roadmap.md if milestone complete
- [ ] Verify all docs use consistent M#.#.# naming

---

## 🚨 ENFORCEMENT & NON-COMPLIANCE

### **Red Flags**

**STOP immediately if you see:**
- ❌ References like "Phase 3" without M#.#.# prefix
- ❌ "Step 2" or "Story 4" without proper hierarchy
- ❌ Mixed naming conventions in same document
- ❌ Work not documented in current-story.md
- ❌ Status indicators used incorrectly
- ❌ Missing updates to project-index.md after completion

### **Correction Process**

1. **Identify non-compliance** in any documentation
2. **Stop current work** - don't propagate incorrect naming
3. **Correct all instances** across all documentation
4. **Verify consistency** in current-story.md, project-index.md, roadmap.md
5. **Resume work** with correct naming

### **Prevention**

- **Session startup**: Always read this document first
- **Regular checks**: Reference this doc when documenting work
- **Documentation reviews**: Verify naming before marking complete
- **Consistency validation**: Cross-check multiple docs for agreement
