- startDate: Date
- endDate: Date
- createdDate: Date
- modifiedDate: Date
// Relationships
- plannedMeals: [PlannedMeal] (one-to-many)
- weeklyList: WeeklyList? (one-to-one, optional)

PlannedMeal Entity:
- id: UUID (primary key)
- plannedDate: Date
- completedDate: Date? (for tracking actual meal preparation)
- createdDate: Date
// Relationships  
- recipe: Recipe (many-to-one)
- mealPlan: MealPlan (many-to-one)
```

#### Core Functionality
