# Architecture Decision Record: Custom Category Sort Order

**Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Story 1.3 completion and Story 1.3.5 planning

---

## Decision Summary

We will implement custom sort order functionality for grocery categories to enable users to organize categories based on their individual store layouts and shopping patterns, enhancing grocery shopping efficiency.

## Context & Motivation

### User-Driven Requirement
During Story 1.3 development, a critical real-world insight emerged:
> "I would like to be able provide a custom sort order for the view of those categories as well. The reason for this is really more how a grocery store is setup and I traverse it."

### Current Limitation
- **Fixed Category Order**: Categories currently display in alphabetical order
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: All users see the same category sequence regardless of their shopping patterns
- **Inefficient Shopping**: Category order doesn't match actual store traversal patterns
- **Store Variation**: Different grocery stores have different layouts requiring different optimal sequences

### Real-World Shopping Patterns
**Typical Store Layout Variations**:
- **Store A**: Produce → Deli → Dairy → Frozen → Pantry → Checkout
- **Store B**: Dairy → Produce → Meat → Frozen → Pantry → Checkout  
- **Store C**: Pantry → Frozen → Dairy → Deli → Produce → Checkout

**Current Fixed Order** (alphabetical):
1. Boxed & Canned
2. Bread & Frozen  
3. Dairy & Fridge
4. Deli & Meat
5. Produce
6. Snacks, Drinks, & Other

**User's Optimal Order** (store layout):
1. Produce (entrance)
2. Deli & Meat (perimeter)
3. Dairy & Fridge (back wall)
4. Bread & Frozen (side aisles)
5. Boxed & Canned (center aisles)
6. Snacks, Drinks, & Other (checkout)

## Decision

### Implement Custom Category Sort Order in Story 1.3.5

**Core Implementation**:
1. **Enhanced Category Entity**: Add `sortOrder` attribute to support custom sequencing
2. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Enable users to reorder categories via intuitive UI
3. **Persistent Custom Order**: Save and apply user-defined order across all views
4. **Default Order**: Provide sensible defaults while enabling full customization

### Technical Architecture

#### Enhanced Core Data Model
```swift
Category Entity:
├── id: UUID (primary key)
├── name: String (category name)
├── color: String (visual identifier)
├── sortOrder: Int16 (custom sort sequence) ← NEW
├── isDefault: Boolean (system category protection) ← NEW
├── dateCreated: Date (audit trail)
└── relationship: groceryItems (one-to-many)
```

#### Sort Order Management
```swift
// Custom fetch requests using sort order
@FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: [
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Category.sortOrder, ascending: true),
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Category.name, ascending: true) // fallback
    ]
) private var categories: FetchedResults<Category>

// Drag-and-drop reordering
func updateSortOrder(from source: IndexSet, to destination: Int) {
    // Update sortOrder values for affected categories
    // Persist changes with background context
}
```

#### Views Affected by Custom Sort
- **StaplesView**: Categories display in shopping order
- **Grocery Lists**: Generated lists follow store traversal pattern
- **Add/Edit Forms**: Category pickers use custom order  
- **Category Management**: Drag-and-drop reordering interface
- **Analytics Views**: Category-based reports use meaningful order

### User Experience Design

#### Category Management Interface
```
ManageCategoriesView:
├── Header: "Organize Categories"
├── Subtitle: "Drag to match your store layout"
├── Draggable List:
│   ├── 🥬 Produce (handle icon)
│   ├── 🥩 Deli & Meat (handle icon)  
│   ├── 🥛 Dairy & Fridge (handle icon)
│   └── ... (custom order)
├── Actions:
│   ├── "Reset to Default Order" 
│   └── "Save Changes"
```

#### Shopping Efficiency Benefits
- **Logical Traversal**: Categories appear in the order users encounter them
- **Reduced Backtracking**: Shopping lists organized by store flow
- **Personal Optimization**: Each user can optimize for their primary store
- **Muscle Memory**: Consistent order builds efficient shopping habits

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Category Entity Enhancement (1 hour)
- **Add sortOrder attribute** to Category entity with migration
- **Add isDefault attribute** to protect system categories
- **Update category creation** to assign initial sort order values
- **Migrate existing hardcoded categories** with logical default order

### Phase 2: Sort Order Integration (1 hour) 
- **Update all @FetchRequest instances** to use sortOrder primary sorting
- **Modify category pickers** in AddStapleView and EditStapleView
- **Update StaplesView grouping** to respect custom category order
- **Test sort order application** across all category-grouped views

### Phase 3: Drag-and-Drop Interface (1 hour)
- **Create ManageCategoriesView** with drag-and-drop list interface
- **Implement reordering logic** with proper sortOrder updates
- **Add visual feedback** during drag operations
- **Include reset to default** functionality for user convenience

### Benefits Delivered

#### Shopping Efficiency
- **Store-Optimized Navigation**: Categories match actual shopping flow
- **Reduced Shopping Time**: Eliminate backtracking through organized lists
- **Personal Store Adaptation**: Support for different primary stores
- **Professional Shopping Experience**: Feel like a grocery shopping expert

#### Technical Excellence
- **Flexible Architecture**: Supports any number of categories in any order
- **Performance Optimized**: Sort order integrated with existing indexed queries
- **User Data Preservation**: Maintains custom order across app updates
- **Default Protection**: System categories cannot be accidentally deleted

#### User Experience
- **Intuitive Control**: Drag-and-drop feels natural and immediate
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of current order and changes
- **Mistake Recovery**: Easy reset to default if customization goes wrong
- **Cross-View Consistency**: Custom order applies everywhere categories appear

## Alternative Considered

### Store Template System
**Approach**: Predefined store layout templates (Walmart, Kroger, Safeway, etc.)
**Rejected Because**: 
- Store layouts vary by location even within same chain
- Users shop multiple stores with different patterns
- Custom personal order more flexible than template selection
- Implementation complexity significantly higher

### Category Grouping
**Approach**: Group categories into store sections (Perimeter, Aisles, Checkout)
**Rejected Because**:
- Less granular than individual category ordering
- Users already understand category-level organization
- Current 6-category system optimal granularity for grocery shopping
- Would require additional UI complexity without proportional benefit

## Success Criteria

### User Experience Metrics
- **Setup Completion**: 80% of users customize category order within first week
- **Shopping Efficiency**: Subjective improvement in shopping flow organization
- **Feature Retention**: Custom order maintained and refined over time
- **Cross-View Consistency**: Order applied consistently across all category displays

### Technical Performance Metrics
- **Drag-and-Drop Responsiveness**: < 100ms response to drag operations
- **Sort Order Query Performance**: No degradation in category-grouped view loading
- **Data Migration Success**: 100% successful migration from hardcoded to dynamic
- **Order Persistence**: Custom order maintained across app launches and updates

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Store Management
- **Multiple Store Profiles**: Different category orders for different stores
- **Location-Based Switching**: Automatic order switching based on GPS location
- **Store Layout Sharing**: Share optimal orders with family members
- **Community Templates**: Optional sharing of successful store layouts

### Smart Order Suggestions
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Suggest order improvements based on shopping behavior
- **Time-Based Optimization**: Different orders for quick trips vs full shopping
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Adaptive ordering based on seasonal shopping patterns
