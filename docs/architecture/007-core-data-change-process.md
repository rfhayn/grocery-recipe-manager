# Architecture Decision Record: 007 - Core Data Schema Change Process

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: M3 Structured Quantity Management - Phase 1-2 Implementation  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

---

## Decision Summary

We will require a comprehensive **Core Data Impact Analysis** before making ANY schema changes, including mandatory project-wide searches and documented file checklists in all PRDs.

---

## Context

### Problem Encountered (M3 Phase 1-2)

During M3 implementation, we changed the Core Data schema (removed `quantity` and `unit` fields, added structured quantity fields) and encountered:

**What Went Wrong:**
1. Changed schema without searching for property usage first
2. Found affected files through build errors (reactive approach)
3. Spent 30 minutes fixing files one-by-one
4. 10 files affected total (found incrementally through errors)
5. Process was stressful and inefficient

**What Should Have Happened:**
1. Search project for property usage BEFORE changes (10 minutes)
2. Document all affected files in PRD (complete checklist)
3. Update files systematically in dependency order
4. Build once at end with zero errors

**Impact:**
- Time lost: ~30 minutes of reactive fixing
- Developer stress: High (surprise after surprise)
- Process quality: Poor (reactive vs proactive)
- Documentation gap: No impact analysis in PRD

### The Core Problem

**Core Data schema changes have ripple effects**, but we had no systematic way to:
1. Identify all affected files before starting
2. Plan updates in correct dependency order
3. Estimate time accurately based on actual impact
4. Prevent surprise files during implementation

---

## Decision

### Mandatory Core Data Impact Analysis

**For ANY Core Data schema change, we will:**

1. **Pre-Implementation Search (REQUIRED)**
   - Search entire project for property usage
   - Document ALL affected files with line numbers
   - Categorize files by layer (Core Data, Service, UI, Other)
   - Include search methodology in PRD

2. **Impact Analysis Section in PRD (REQUIRED)**
   - List all affected files with update descriptions
   - Document update strategy in dependency order
   - Provide time estimates per file category
   - Include risk assessment

3. **Systematic Update Process (REQUIRED)**
   - Update files in dependency order (Core Data → Service → UI)
   - Use checklist to track completion
   - Build once after all updates complete
   - Document any unexpected files found

4. **Template Usage (REQUIRED)**
   - Use `docs/templates/core-data-impact-analysis.md`
   - Complete template before PRD approval
   - Validate file list completeness
   - Update template based on lessons learned

---

## Decision Details

### Mandatory Searches

**Before ANY Core Data schema change:**

```bash
# In Xcode (⌘⇧F - Find in Project)

1. Direct property access:
   Search: ".propertyName"
   Example: ".quantity"
   
2. String literals:
   Search: "propertyName"
   Example: "quantity"
   
3. KeyPath references:
   Search: \\Entity.propertyName
   Example: \\Ingredient.quantity
   
4. Predicate usage:
   Search: NSPredicate.*propertyName
   Example: NSPredicate.*quantity
```

**Document Results:**
- List every file found
- Note line numbers
- Describe required change
- Estimate time per file

### Required PRD Section

**Every PRD with Core Data changes MUST include:**

```markdown
## Core Data Impact Analysis

### Schema Changes
- Entities Modified: [List]
- Properties Removed: [List with types]
- Properties Added: [List with types]
- Relationships Changed: [List]

### Comprehensive Search Completed: ✅
**Search Method**: Xcode Find in Project (⌘⇧F)
**Properties Searched**: [List each search term]
**Total Files Found**: [Number]

### Affected Files

#### Core Data Layer
- [ ] File.swift:LineNum - [Change description]

#### Service Layer  
- [ ] File.swift:LineNum - [Change description]

#### UI Layer
- [ ] File.swift:LineNum - [Change description]

#### Other
- [ ] File.swift:LineNum - [Change description]

### Update Strategy
1. Phase 1: Core Data schema + property generation
2. Phase 2: Service layer updates
3. Phase 3: UI layer updates (in order)
4. Phase 4: Sample data + other

### Time Estimate
- Schema: [X] min
- Service ([N] files × 15 min): [Y] min
- UI ([N] files × 10 min): [Z] min
- Other ([N] files × 5 min): [W] min
- Buffer (30%): [B] min
- **Total: [TOTAL] min ([HOURS] hours)**

### Risk Assessment
- High Risk: [Files where errors break app]
- Medium Risk: [Files where errors degrade UX]
- Low Risk: [Files where errors are cosmetic]
```

### Update Dependency Order

**Always update in this order:**

1. **Core Data Schema** (.xcdatamodeld)
   - Modify entities/properties
   - Set codegen appropriately
   - Add indexes if needed

2. **Property Files** (Entity+CoreDataProperties.swift)
   - Delete old property files
   - Regenerate via Editor → Create NSManagedObject Subclass
   - Verify property types match expectations

3. **Service Layer** (Services/*.swift)
   - Update parsing services
   - Update data services
   - Update migration services

4. **UI Layer** (Views/*.swift)
   - Update in dependency order
   - Forms before displays
   - Parent views before child views

5. **Other** (Persistence.swift, Tests, etc.)
   - Update sample data
   - Update test fixtures
   - Update preview providers

### Time Estimation Formula

```
Total Time = Schema Time + (Service Files × 15min) + (UI Files × 10min) + (Other × 5min) + 30% Buffer

Example (M3):
- Schema: 60min
- Service (1 × 15): 15min
- UI (5 × 10): 50min  
- Other (1 × 5): 5min
- Subtotal: 130min
- Buffer (30%): 39min
- Total: 169min (~2.8 hours)
```

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: "Build Will Tell Us" Approach
**Description**: Make schema changes, fix build errors as they appear  
**Rejected Because**:
- Reactive instead of proactive
- Wastes time on iterative fixing
- Causes developer stress
- Misses files that don't cause immediate errors
- No systematic approach

### Alternative 2: "Dual Storage" Migration
**Description**: Keep old fields, add new fields, migrate gradually  
**Rejected Because**:
- Creates technical debt
- Confusing which field to use
- Doubles storage requirements
- Complicates codebase unnecessarily
- Not suitable for pre-production apps

### Alternative 3: "Manual Expertise" Approach
**Description**: Rely on developer memory of affected files  
**Rejected Because**:
- Human memory is fallible
- Not scalable to team
- No documentation
- Misses files inevitably
- No process improvement

### Why Our Solution Is Better
- ✅ Systematic and repeatable
- ✅ Complete and comprehensive
- ✅ Documented and teachable
- ✅ Proactive not reactive
- ✅ Scales to any team size
- ✅ Creates institutional knowledge
