## M3: STRUCTURED QUANTITY MANAGEMENT (8-12 hours)

### **Goal:**
Transform ingredient and grocery list quantity management from string-based to structured numeric + unit fields, enabling recipe scaling, intelligent shopping consolidation, and analytics foundation while maintaining backward compatibility and user input flexibility.

### **Problem Statement:**
**Current State**: All quantities stored as strings ("2 cups", "a pinch", "1 1/2 lbs")
**Limitations**:
- No mathematical operations: Cannot scale recipes or combine quantities
- No unit conversions or price-per-unit analysis
- Nutritional tracking and spending analysis impossible with string data
- No quantity-based sorting or intelligent shopping features

**User Value Gap**: Users cannot scale recipes for different servings, shopping lists don't combine duplicate ingredients intelligently, and no foundation exists for nutrition or budget tracking

**Strategic Opportunity**: Hybrid approach enabling structured data benefits while preserving user input flexibility ("a pinch" remains valid)

### **Solution Overview:**
Implement hybrid quantity system with structured numeric + unit fields alongside original text preservation, enabling mathematical operations where possible while maintaining support for imprecise measurements.

### **Implementation Plan (8-12 hours total):**

#### **Phase 1: Hybrid Quantity Architecture (3-4 hours)**

**1.1 Core Data Model Updates (60-90 minutes)**
- Create QuantityComponent entity with hybrid fields:
  - `numericValue: Double?` - Parsed numeric value (2.0, 1.5, nil)
  - `unit: String?` - Standardized unit ("cups", "lbs", nil)
  - `originalText: String` - Original user input ("2 cups", "a pinch")
  - `isParseable: Bool` - Indicates if quantity can be used in calculations
  - `userNotified: Bool` - Tracks if user was informed about calculation limitations
- Add relationships to Ingredient and GroceryListItem entities
- Design migration strategy preserving all existing string quantities
- Test Core Data model changes with existing data

**1.2 Quantity Parsing Service (90-120 minutes)**
- Implement intelligent parsing engine:
  - Parse standard measurements: "2 cups", "1.5 lbs", "3/4 teaspoon"
  - Handle fractional inputs: "1 1/2" → 1.5, "2/3" → 0.667
  - Recognize common units: volume (cups, tbsp, ml), weight (lbs, oz, kg), count (pieces, cloves)
- Unparseable quantity handling:
  - Flag as non-parseable: "a pinch", "to taste", "handful"
  - Preserve original text without restriction
  - User notification system for calculation limitations
- Unit standardization and alias support
- Performance optimization: < 0.1s per quantity

**1.3 Unit Management System (60 minutes)**
- Define unit categories: Volume, Weight, Count, Temperature
- Implement unit aliases: "cup"/"cups", "tablespoon"/"tbsp"/"T"
- Unit validation preventing invalid combinations
- Custom unit creation capability for specialized ingredients

#### **Phase 2: Recipe Scaling Intelligence (2-3 hours)**

**2.1 Scaling Engine Implementation (90-120 minutes)**
- Mathematical scaling for all parseable quantities
- Proportional calculation with intelligent rounding
- Practical measurement conversion: 1.33 cups suggests "1 1/3 cups"
- Handle fractional scaling factors: 1.5x, 0.75x, 2x
- Scaling history tracking for user reference

**2.2 Mixed Quantity Handling (60-90 minutes)**
- Auto-scale parseable ingredients proportionally
- Unparseable quantity guidance:
  - Display with scaling note: "a pinch (adjust to taste for X servings)"
  - Provide cooking guidance: "For 2x recipe, start with 1.5x seasoning"
  - Manual override capability if user chooses
- Scaling summary display: "12 ingredients auto-scaled, 3 require manual adjustment"
- User education about which quantities were scaled vs. require attention

#### **Phase 3: Shopping List Consolidation (2-3 hours)**

**3.1 Intelligent Quantity Merging (90-120 minutes)**
- Combine same ingredients with same units: "1 cup flour" + "2 cups flour" = "3 cups flour"
- Suggest unit conversions for different units of same ingredient
- Handle unit conversion edge cases gracefully
- Maintain source tracking: show which recipes contributed to consolidated quantity
- Consolidation preview with user approval before applying

**3.2 Mixed Parseable/Unparseable Consolidation (60 minutes)**
- Group parseable quantities mathematically
- List unparseable separately: "3 cups flour, plus: a pinch (Recipe A), to taste (Recipe B)"
- Allow manual conversion of unparseable to parseable if user desires
- Clear visual distinction between calculated and text quantities

#### **Phase 4: Migration & User Experience (1-2 hours)**

**4.1 Data Migration Process (60 minutes)**
- Batch parsing of all existing quantity strings
- Migration preview showing parsed vs. unparsed breakdown
- User review interface for validation
- Manual correction capability for incorrect parses
- Rollback mechanism if errors detected
- Progress tracking and comprehensive error reporting

**4.2 User Experience Enhancement (30-60 minutes)**
- Visual indicators: parsed quantities (calculator icon) vs unparsed (text icon)
- Non-intrusive notification system:
  - Inline badges: "Not included in calculations"
  - One-time tooltips explaining limitations
  - Info icons for on-demand explanations
- Performance optimization throughout
- Accessibility compliance for all new UI elements

### **Technical Implementation Requirements:**
