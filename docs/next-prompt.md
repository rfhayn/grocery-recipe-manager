## M2.2.7: RECIPE SEARCH ENHANCEMENT (30 minutes)

### **Goal:**
Enhance recipe search capabilities beyond basic name matching to include ingredients, tags, and instructions, with performance optimization and intelligent result ranking for superior recipe discovery experience.

### **Problem Statement:**
**Current State**: Recipe search limited to basic recipe name filtering using simple @State searchText
**Missing Capabilities**: No search across ingredients, tags, or instructions; no result ranking; limited discoverability
**User Value Gap**: Users cannot find recipes by ingredients they want to use or cooking techniques they're interested in
**Performance Opportunity**: Current search adequate but can be optimized for expanded scope

### **Solution Overview:**
Implement comprehensive multi-field search across recipe names, ingredients, tags, and instructions with intelligent result ranking and performance optimization, while maintaining sub-millisecond response times.

### **Implementation Plan (30 minutes total):**

#### **Phase 1: Enhanced Search Infrastructure (10 minutes)**

**1.1 Multi-Field Search Implementation (8 minutes)**
- Extend search to include recipe.instructions, recipe.tags, and ingredient names from recipe.ingredients relationships
- Implement Core Data compound predicate combining multiple search fields
- Add case-insensitive, diacritic-insensitive search across all fields
- Optimize query performance with proper relationship fetching

**1.2 Search Performance Optimization (2 minutes)**
- Add Core Data indexes on frequently searched fields (recipe.name, recipe.instructions, recipe.tags)
- Implement efficient relationship loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Validate search performance maintains < 0.1s response times with expanded scope

#### **Phase 2: Intelligent Result Ranking (10 minutes)**

**2.1 Search Relevance Scoring (6 minutes)**
- Implement priority ordering: exact name matches → partial name matches → ingredient matches → tag matches → instruction matches
- Add usage-based relevance: frequently used recipes rank higher in search results
- Implement recipe.usageCount integration for relevance weighting
- Maintain alphabetical secondary sorting within relevance groups

**2.2 Advanced Search Patterns (4 minutes)**
- Add support for multiple search terms (space-separated)
- Implement "contains all terms" vs "contains any term" logic
- Add search term highlighting preparation (foundation for future enhancement)
- Handle edge cases: empty search, single character searches, special characters

#### **Phase 3: Enhanced User Experience (10 minutes)**

**3.1 Search Result Enhancement (6 minutes)**
- Add visual indicators showing why recipes matched (ingredient badge, tag badge, etc.)
- Implement search result count display: "Found X recipes"
- Add quick search suggestions based on popular ingredients or tags
- Enhance empty state with search tips and popular recipe suggestions

**3.2 Search History Foundation (4 minutes)**
- Implement basic search term persistence using UserDefaults
- Add recent searches dropdown/suggestions (limit to 5-10 recent terms)
- Include search analytics foundation for future M7 usage insights
- Ensure search history respects user privacy (local storage only)

### **Technical Implementation Requirements:**

**Enhanced Core Data Query:**
```swift
// Example enhanced search predicate structure
func searchPredicate(for searchText: String) -> NSPredicate {
    let trimmed = searchText.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    guard !trimmed.isEmpty else { return NSPredicate(value: true) }
    
    let nameSearch = NSPredicate(format: "name CONTAINS[cd] %@", trimmed)
    let instructionsSearch = NSPredicate(format: "instructions CONTAINS[cd] %@", trimmed)
    let tagsSearch = NSPredicate(format: "tags CONTAINS[cd] %@", trimmed)
    let ingredientSearch = NSPredicate(format: "ANY ingredients.name CONTAINS[cd] %@", trimmed)
    
    return NSCompoundPredicate(orPredicateWithSubpredicates: [
        nameSearch, instructionsSearch, tagsSearch, ingredientSearch
    ])
}
```

**Search Result Ranking:**
```swift
// Example relevance-based sorting
@FetchRequest(
    sortDescriptors: [
        // Primary: Relevance score (computed)
        // Secondary: Usage count (descending)
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Recipe.usageCount, ascending: false),
        // Tertiary: Alphabetical
        NSSortDescriptor(keyPath: \Recipe.name, ascending: true)
    ]
) private var searchResults: FetchedResults<Recipe>
```

**Performance Optimization Points:**
- **Core Data Indexes**: Add indexes on searchable fields in Core Data model
- **Relationship Fetching**: Optimize ingredient relationship loading
- **Query Batching**: Implement efficient batch loading for search results
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of search-related resources

### **Success Criteria:**
- **Enhanced Search Scope**: Search works across recipe names, ingredients, tags, and instructions
- **Performance Maintained**: All search operations complete in < 0.1s with expanded functionality
- **Intelligent Ranking**: Results show most relevant recipes first based on match type and usage
- **User Experience**: Professional search interface with result counts and match indicators
- **Foundation Ready**: Search infrastructure prepared for M2.3 Recipe Creation workflows
- **Privacy Compliant**: Search history stored locally with user control

### **Validation Plan:**
- **Multi-Field Search**: Test search across all supported fields (name, ingredients, tags, instructions)
- **Performance Testing**: Validate search speed with large recipe collections (100+ recipes)
- **Relevance Validation**: Confirm proper result ordering with mixed match types
- **Edge Case Handling**: Test empty searches, special characters, very long search terms
- **User Experience**: Verify search result counts, visual indicators, and professional UI patterns
- **Integration Testing**: Confirm search works with existing filtering and category functionality

### **Enhanced Search Capabilities:**

1. **Recipe Name Search**: Exact and partial matches with highest priority
2. **Ingredient Search**: Find recipes containing specific ingredients (via recipe.ingredients relationship)
3. **Tag Search**: Discover recipes by cooking method, cuisine type, dietary restrictions
4. **Instruction Search**: Find recipes by cooking techniques or specific preparation steps
5. **Usage-Weighted Results**: Popular recipes surface higher in search results
6. **Multi-Term Search**: Support for "chicken pasta" finding recipes with both terms
7. **Search History**: Recent searches for improved user experience
8. **Performance Optimized**: Indexed queries maintaining sub-millisecond response times

### **User Experience Enhancement:**
1. **Comprehensive Discovery**: Users can find recipes by any aspect (name, ingredient, technique, etc.)
2. **Intelligent Results**: Most relevant and popular recipes appear first
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of why recipes matched search terms
4. **Quick Access**: Recent searches and popular suggestions for faster recipe discovery
5. **Professional Polish**: Search experience matching iOS standards with accessibility support

### **Post-Implementation:**
After M2.2.7 completion, ready for:
- **M2.2.8**: Usage Tracking Foundation (30 minutes) - Advanced analytics and statistics beyond basic mark-as-used
- **M2.3**: Recipe Creation & Editing (4-5 hours) - Complete recipe management with editing capabilities
