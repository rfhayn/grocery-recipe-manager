# Session Startup Checklist

**Purpose**: Mandatory startup procedure for every Claude development session  
**Last Updated**: October 23, 2025  
**Required Reading**: **EVERY SESSION** - No exceptions

---

## üöÄ CRITICAL: START HERE EVERY SESSION

This checklist ensures:
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming conventions (M#.#.# format)
- ‚úÖ Current project context loaded
- ‚úÖ No duplicate work or services
- ‚úÖ Documentation continuity
- ‚úÖ Efficient development workflow

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes  
**Impact**: Prevents hours of rework and confusion

---

## üìã THE CHECKLIST

### **PHASE 1: CONTEXT LOADING** (Required for ALL sessions)

#### **1. Read Session Startup Checklist** ‚úÖ
**Location**: `docs/session-startup-checklist.md` (this file)  
**Purpose**: Ensure you follow the complete startup procedure  
**Action**: You're doing it right now!

#### **2. Read Project Naming Standards** ‚úÖ
**Location**: `docs/project-naming-standards.md`  
**Purpose**: Understand M#.#.# naming hierarchy and status indicators  
**What to verify:**
- [ ] Current active milestone (e.g., M4)
- [ ] Current active component (e.g., M4.1)
- [ ] Status indicator meanings (‚úÖ üîÑ üöÄ ‚è≥)
- [ ] Quick reference card at top of document

**Key Takeaway**: 
```
Always use full identifiers: "M4.1.2" not "Phase 2" or "Step 2"
```

#### **3. Read Current Story** ‚úÖ
**Location**: `docs/current-story.md`  
**Purpose**: Understand current milestone progress and what's active  
**What to capture:**
- [ ] Current milestone number and name
- [ ] Active phases/components with üîÑ ACTIVE status
- [ ] Recently completed work with ‚úÖ COMPLETE status
- [ ] Next planned work with üöÄ READY status
- [ ] Any blockers or open questions

**Key Takeaway**: What work is active RIGHT NOW?

---

### **PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION PREPARATION** (Required if doing development work)

#### **4. Read Next Prompt** ‚úÖ
**Location**: `docs/next-prompt.md`  
**Purpose**: Get specific implementation guidance for current active work  
**What to review:**
- [ ] Phase breakdown and time estimates
- [ ] Technical requirements
- [ ] Integration points
- [ ] Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Files that will be modified

**Key Takeaway**: Copy-paste ready implementation plan for current session

#### **5. Search Project Knowledge for Core Data Schema** ‚úÖ
**When**: If working with data model (entities, relationships, migrations)  
**Search queries to use:**
```
"Core Data entity [EntityName] properties relationships"
"[EntityName] codegen fetch indexes"
"Core Data schema current"
```

**What to document:**
- [ ] Existing properties and exact types
- [ ] All relationships and inverses
- [ ] Codegen settings (Manual/None vs Class Definition)
- [ ] Fetch indexes present
- [ ] Recent migration history

**Key Takeaway**: Never assume schema - always verify current state

#### **6. Review Relevant ADRs** ‚úÖ
**Location**: `docs/architecture/`  
**When**: Working on features with architectural implications  
**What to search:**
```
"architecture decision [feature area]"
"ADR [technology or pattern]"
```

**Key ADRs to know:**
- ADR 001: Selective Technical Improvements
- ADR 006: Consolidate Staples and Ingredients
- ADR 007: Core Data Change Process

**Key Takeaway**: Don't reinvent patterns - follow established decisions

#### **7. Search for Existing Services** ‚úÖ
**When**: Before creating ANY new service or infrastructure  
**Search queries to use:**
```
"Service [functionality] implementation"
"Parse [data type]"
"[Feature] pattern existing"
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Similar services already exist?
- [ ] Can existing service be extended?
- [ ] Established patterns in similar features?
- [ ] Relevant implementations in learning notes?

**Proven services to leverage:**
- OptimizedRecipeDataService (Core Data operations)
- IngredientParsingService (text parsing)
- IngredientTemplateService (normalization)
- QuantityMergeService (consolidation)
- UnitConversionService (measurements)
- RecipeScalingService (recipe scaling)

**Key Takeaway**: Search before creating - avoid duplicate infrastructure

---

## ‚úÖ CHECKLIST COMPLETION

**Before writing ANY code, verify you've completed:**

**Phase 1: Context Loading** (ALL sessions)
- [x] Read session-startup-checklist.md (this file)
- [ ] Read project-naming-standards.md
- [ ] Read current-story.md

**Phase 2: Implementation Preparation** (Development sessions only)
- [ ] Read next-prompt.md
- [ ] Search for Core Data schema (if needed)
- [ ] Review relevant ADRs (if needed)
- [ ] Search for existing services (if creating new infrastructure)

**Red Flag Check:**
- [ ] No duplicate services being created
- [ ] Using correct M#.#.# naming convention
- [ ] Current work documented in current-story.md
- [ ] Architecture patterns match existing decisions

---

## üéØ QUICK WINS FROM THIS CHECKLIST

### **Prevents These Common Issues:**

‚ùå **Without Checklist:**
- Creating duplicate services that already exist
- Using inconsistent naming (Phase 1 vs M4.1)
- Breaking existing Core Data relationships
- Contradicting established architecture decisions
- Starting work that's not documented
- Missing critical context from previous sessions

‚úÖ **With Checklist:**
- Consistent naming across all documentation
- Leveraging existing proven services
- Following established patterns
- Building on current work correctly
- Maintaining documentation continuity

## üí° PRO TIPS

### **First Session of the Day**
Complete ALL 7 checklist items - full context load is critical

### **Continuing Previous Session's Work**
Can skip items 5-7 if:
- Working on same feature
- No Core Data changes planned
- No new services being created

BUT always complete items 1-4 - these ensure naming consistency and current context

### **Starting New Milestone/Component**
Complete ALL 7 items + additionally review:
- Relevant PRDs in `docs/prds/`
- Similar milestone learning notes
- Related ADRs for the feature area

### **Quick Context Refreshes**
If interrupted or switching contexts mid-session:
1. Re-read current-story.md (item 3)
2. Re-read next-prompt.md (item 4)
3. Verify M#.#.# naming still correct

---

## üö® ENFORCEMENT

### **This Checklist is MANDATORY**

**Non-compliance indicators:**
- Using "Phase" or "Step" without M#.#.# identifier
- Creating services that duplicate existing ones
- Core Data changes without schema verification
- Documentation updates without checking current-story.md
- Code that contradicts established patterns

**If you catch non-compliance:**
1. Stop current work
2. Re-read this checklist
3. Complete missing items
4. Correct any inconsistencies
5. Resume work with proper context

### **Success Validation**

**Before committing ANY code or documentation:**
- [ ] All files use M#.#.# naming consistently
- [ ] current-story.md updated with progress
- [ ] No duplicate services or infrastructure
- [ ] Architecture follows established ADRs
- [ ] Documentation uses correct status indicators (‚úÖ üîÑ üöÄ ‚è≥)
