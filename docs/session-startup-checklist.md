- ✅ No duplicate work or services
- ✅ Documentation continuity
- ✅ Efficient development workflow
- ✅ Clean git history with feature branches

**Estimated Time**: 10-15 minutes

---

## 📋 THE CHECKLIST

### **PHASE 1: CONTEXT LOADING** (Required for ALL sessions)

#### **1. Read Session Startup Checklist** ✅
**Location**: `docs/session-startup-checklist.md` (this file)  
**Purpose**: Ensure you follow the complete startup procedure  
**Action**: You're doing it right now!

#### **2. Read Project Naming Standards** ✅
**Location**: `docs/project-naming-standards.md`  
**Purpose**: Understand M#.#.# naming hierarchy and status indicators  
**What to verify:**
- [ ] Current active milestone (e.g., M7)
- [ ] Current active component (e.g., M7.1)
- [ ] Status indicator meanings (✅ 🔄 🚀 ⏳)
- [ ] Quick reference card at top of document

**Key Takeaway**: 
```
Always use full identifiers: "M7.1.3" not "Phase 3" or "Step 3"
```

#### **3. Read Current Story** ✅
**Location**: `docs/current-story.md`  
**Purpose**: Understand current milestone progress and what's active  
**What to capture:**
- [ ] Current milestone number and name
- [ ] Active phases/components with 🔄 ACTIVE status
- [ ] Recently completed work with ✅ COMPLETE status
- [ ] Next planned work with 🚀 READY status
- [ ] Any blockers or open questions

**Key Takeaway**: What work is active RIGHT NOW?

---

### **PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION PREPARATION** (Required if doing development work)

#### **4. Read Next Prompt** ✅
**Location**: `docs/next-prompt.md`  
**Purpose**: Get specific implementation guidance for current active work  
**What to review:**
- [ ] Phase breakdown and time estimates
- [ ] Technical requirements
- [ ] Integration points
- [ ] Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Files that will be modified

**Key Takeaway**: Copy-paste ready implementation plan for current session

#### **5. Search Project Knowledge for Core Data Schema** ✅
**When**: If working with data model (entities, relationships, migrations)  
**Search queries to use:**
```
"Core Data entity [EntityName] properties relationships"
"[EntityName] codegen fetch indexes"
"Core Data schema current"
```

**What to document:**
- [ ] Existing properties and exact types
- [ ] All relationships and inverses
- [ ] Codegen settings (Manual/None vs Class Definition)
- [ ] Fetch indexes present
- [ ] Recent migration history

**Key Takeaway**: Never assume schema - always verify current state

#### **6. Review Relevant ADRs** ✅
**Location**: `docs/architecture/`  
**When**: Working on features with architectural implications  
**What to search:**
```
"architecture decision [feature area]"
"ADR [technology or pattern]"
```

**Key ADRs to know:**
- ADR 001: Selective Technical Improvements
- ADR 006: Consolidate Staples and Ingredients
- ADR 007: Core Data Change Process

**Key Takeaway**: Don't reinvent patterns - follow established decisions

#### **7. Search for Existing Services** ✅
**When**: Before creating ANY new service or infrastructure  
**Search queries to use:**
```
"Service [functionality] implementation"
"Parse [data type]"
"[Feature] pattern existing"
```

**What to check:**
- [ ] Similar services already exist?
- [ ] Can existing service be extended?
- [ ] Established patterns in similar features?
- [ ] Relevant implementations in learning notes?

**Proven services to leverage:**
- OptimizedRecipeDataService (Core Data operations)
- IngredientParsingService (text parsing)
- IngredientTemplateService (normalization)
- QuantityMergeService (consolidation)
- UnitConversionService (measurements)
- RecipeScalingService (recipe scaling)
- CloudKitSyncMonitor (sync monitoring)

**Key Takeaway**: Search before creating - avoid duplicate infrastructure

#### **8. Create Feature Branch for Phase** ✅
**Location**: Git command line  
**When**: Before writing ANY code for a phase  
**Purpose**: Isolate phase work for clean history, safe experimentation, and easy rollback

**Git Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch (format: feature/M#.#.#-brief-description)
git checkout -b feature/M7.1.3-multi-device-testing

# Examples:
# git checkout -b feature/M7.1.1-cloudkit-schema
# git checkout -b feature/M7.1.2-sync-monitoring
# git checkout -b feature/M7.2.1-ckshare-implementation

# 3. Verify you're on the new branch
git branch  # Should show * feature/M7.1.3-...

# 4. Create initial checkpoint (commit planning docs if created)
git add docs/M7.1.3-TESTING-PLAN.md  # Or whatever planning docs exist
git commit -m "M7.1.3: Add multi-device testing plan

- 6 testing scenarios documented
- Performance targets established (< 5s sync latency)
- Acceptance criteria defined"

git push -u origin feature/M7.1.3-multi-device-testing
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- Prefix: `feature/` (always)
- Milestone: `M#.#.#` (exact milestone number)
- Description: brief-kebab-case (3-5 words max)

**During Development:**
- Commit frequently (every 15-30 minutes)
- Push after each commit (backs up work to GitHub)
- Use M#.#.# format in all commit messages

**Key Takeaway**: 
- One phase = one branch = one PR = one squash commit to main
- Clean main branch history for easy understanding
- Safe to experiment (can abandon branch if needed)

**See Also**: [git-workflow-for-milestones.md](git-workflow-for-milestones.md) for complete workflow

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **First Session of the Day**
Complete ALL 8 checklist items - full context load is critical

### **Continuing Previous Session's Work**
Can skip items 5-7 if:
- Working on same feature
- No Core Data changes planned
- No new services being created
- Already on correct feature branch

BUT always complete items 1-4 + 8 - these ensure naming consistency and current context

### **Starting New Milestone/Component**
Complete ALL 8 items + additionally review:
- Relevant PRDs in `docs/prds/`
- Similar milestone learning notes
- Related ADRs for the feature area

### **Quick Context Refreshes**
If interrupted or switching contexts mid-session:
1. Re-read current-story.md (item 3)
2. Re-read next-prompt.md (item 4)
3. Verify M#.#.# naming still correct
4. Check git branch: `git branch` (should be on feature branch)

---

## 🚨 ENFORCEMENT

### **This Checklist is MANDATORY**

- Working without creating feature branch first

**If you catch non-compliance:**
1. Stop current work
2. Re-read this checklist
3. Complete missing items
4. Correct any inconsistencies
5. Resume work with proper context

### **Success Validation**
