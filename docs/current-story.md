## M4.1: Settings Infrastructure Foundation - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Completion Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Total Time**: 1.5 hours (estimated: 1.5 hours)  
**Variance**: 0% (perfect estimate accuracy!)  
**Status**: Production Ready

### **What We Built**

**Core Data Entity**:
- UserPreferences entity with single-record pattern
- 7 attributes (id, duration, start day, 2 bools, 2 dates)
- Fetch index on id property
- "Class Definition" codegen (matches M3 IngredientTemplate pattern)
- Made id/dates optional (set programmatically)

**Service Layer**:
- UserPreferencesService with singleton pattern
- @Published properties for SwiftUI reactivity
- Combine auto-save (500ms debounce)
- Validation for duration (3-14 days) and start day (0-6)
- Default creation on first launch
- App-wide accessibility via .shared

**UI Integration**:
- Meal Planning section in Settings (first section)
- Duration stepper (3-14 days, default 7)
- Start day picker (Sunday-Saturday, default Sunday)
- Auto-name toggle (default ON)
- Show recipe sources toggle (default ON)
- Dynamic footer showing current settings
- Integration with existing migration section

### **Achievements**
- ‚úÖ All functional requirements met
- ‚úÖ Settings load < 0.1s (performance target exceeded)

- ‚úÖ 100% test pass rate (all 5 tests)
- ‚úÖ Zero regressions to existing features
- ‚úÖ Professional iOS UI maintained
- ‚úÖ Perfect planning accuracy (1.5h estimated = 1.5h actual)

### **Challenges Solved**
1. **Core Data default values**: Made id/dates optional, set programmatically
2. **View name mismatch**: Found MigrationDebugView vs assumed name
3. **Context passing**: Added @Environment for Core Data access

### **Integration Points Ready**
- ‚úÖ UserPreferencesService.shared accessible app-wide
- ‚úÖ M4.2 can read duration for calendar length
- ‚úÖ M4.2 can read start day for calendar configuration
- ‚úÖ M4.3 can use preferences for display options

## M4.2: Calendar-Based Meal Planning Core - READY üöÄ

**Estimated Time**: 2.5 hours  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core user workflow completion  
**Dependencies**: M4.1 Complete ‚úÖ

### **Strategic Overview**

M4.2 implements calendar-based meal planning with recipe assignment, leveraging M4.1 preferences for user-configurable planning periods.

**What We're Building:**
- MealPlan and PlannedMeal Core Data entities
- Calendar view showing user-configured duration (3-14 days)
- "Add to Meal Plan" buttons in recipe views
- Modal calendar picker for date selection
- Meal plan management (create/edit/delete)
- Recipe assignment workflow
- Auto-naming based on user preferences

**User Flow**:
1. User taps "Meal Planning" tab
2. System checks for existing meal plans
3. If none exist: Create first meal plan with user preferences
4. If exists: Display current plan with calendar
5. User browses recipes, taps "Add to Meal Plan"
6. Modal calendar picker shows available dates
7. User selects date, recipe assigned
8. Calendar updates immediately

### **Foundation Ready from M4.1**

**User Preferences Available**:
```swift
@StateObject private var prefs = UserPreferencesService.shared

let duration = prefs.mealPlanDuration        // 3-14 days
let startDay = prefs.mealPlanStartDay        // 0-6 (Sun-Sat)
let autoName = prefs.autoNameMealPlans       // true/false
let showSources = prefs.showRecipeSourceInMealPlan  // true/false
```

**Integration Points**:
- Calendar length determined by mealPlanDuration
- Calendar start day determined by mealPlanStartDay
- Auto-naming feature ready (if autoNameMealPlans true)
- Recipe source display configurable (if showRecipeSourceInMealPlan true)

### **Phase Breakdown**

**Phase 1: Core Data Model (60 min)**
- Create MealPlan entity (name, startDate, duration, isActive)
- Create PlannedMeal entity (date, servings, scaleFactor)
- Define relationships (MealPlan ‚Üî PlannedMeal, PlannedMeal ‚Üî Recipe)
- Add fetch indexes for date-based queries
- Build and verify schema

**Phase 2: Service Layer (60 min)**
- MealPlanService for CRUD operations
- Create meal plan with user preferences
- Add/remove recipes from dates
- Fetch current active plan
- Archive completed plans

**Phase 3: UI Implementation (30 min)**
- MealPlanView with calendar display
- Calendar cells showing assigned recipes
- "Add to Meal Plan" in RecipeListView and RecipeDetailView
- Date selection modal
- Empty state for new users

**Success Criteria**:
- User can create meal plans with preferred duration
- Recipes can be assigned to specific dates
- Calendar updates in real-time
- One recipe per day constraint enforced
- Performance: < 0.1s for all operations
- Auto-naming works if enabled
