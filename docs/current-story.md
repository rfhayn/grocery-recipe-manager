## M4.2: Calendar-Based Meal Planning Core - IN PROGRESS 🔄

**Total Estimated Time**: 4 hours  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core user workflow completion  
**Dependencies**: M4.1 Complete ✅

### **Strategic Overview**

M4.2 implements calendar-based meal planning with recipe assignment, leveraging M4.1 preferences for user-configurable planning periods. Split into two components:
- **M4.2.1-3**: Calendar and recipe assignment (2.5 hours) 🔄 **ACTIVE**
- **M4.2.4**: Multiple meal plans list view (1.5 hours) 🚀 **READY**

---

## M4.2.1-3: Calendar & Recipe Assignment - ACTIVE 🔄

**Estimated Time**: 2.5 hours  
**Status**: Nearly complete, testing phase

### **What's Being Built**:
- MealPlan and PlannedMeal Core Data entities
- Calendar view showing user-configured duration (3-14 days)
- "Add to Meal Plan" buttons in recipe views
- Modal calendar picker for date selection
- Recipe assignment workflow
- Auto-naming based on user preferences

### **User Flow**:
1. User taps "Meal Planning" tab
2. System checks for existing meal plans
3. If none exist: Create first meal plan with user preferences
4. If exists: Display current plan with calendar
5. User browses recipes, taps "Add to Meal Plan"
6. Modal calendar picker shows available dates
7. User selects date, recipe assigned
8. Calendar updates immediately

### **Foundation Ready from M4.1**:

**User Preferences Available**:
```swift
@StateObject private var prefs = UserPreferencesService.shared

let duration = prefs.mealPlanDuration        // 3-14 days
let startDay = prefs.mealPlanStartDay        // 0-6 (Sun-Sat)
let autoName = prefs.autoNameMealPlans       // true/false
let showSources = prefs.showRecipeSourceInMealPlan  // true/false
```

**Integration Points**:
- Calendar length determined by mealPlanDuration
- Calendar start day determined by mealPlanStartDay
- Auto-naming feature ready (if autoNameMealPlans true)
- Recipe source display configurable (if showRecipeSourceInMealPlan true)

### **Phase Breakdown (Original)**:

## M4.2.4: Multiple Meal Plans List View - READY 🚀

**Estimated Time**: 1.5 hours (90 min)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Completes meal planning foundation  
**Dependencies**: M4.2.1-3 testing complete  
**PRD**: `docs/prds/m4.2.4-multiple-meal-plans-list-view-prd.md` ✅

### **Strategic Overview**

Transform meal planning from single "active plan" view to comprehensive list-based architecture matching the proven WeeklyListsView pattern from M1. Enables multiple concurrent meal plans, historical tracking, and seamless navigation.

### **Architecture Pattern**

**Follows WeeklyListsView (M1)**:
```
Before (M4.2.1-3):               After (M4.2.4):
                                 
Meal Planning Tab                Meal Planning Tab
      ↓                                ↓
MealPlanView                     MealPlansListView (NEW)
├── Single active plan           ├── All meal plans listed
├── Calendar display             ├── Active/Upcoming/Completed
└── Recipe assignment            ├── Create new plan button
                                 └── Tap → MealPlanDetailView
                                          ├── Calendar display
                                          └── Recipe assignment
```

### **What We're Building**

**New Views**:
1. **MealPlansListView** - Main list (like WeeklyListsView)
   - Active plans at top
   - Upcoming plans below
   - Completed plans in collapsible section
   - Create new plan button

2. **MealPlanRowView** - Row component (like WeeklyListRowView)
   - Plan name or date range
   - Progress indicator (X of Y days planned)
   - Status badge (Active/Upcoming/Completed)

3. **SelectMealPlanSheet** - Plan picker (like SelectListSheet)
   - For "Add to Meal Plan" from recipes
   - Shows all plans with active pre-selected
   - Option to create new plan inline

4. **CreateMealPlanSheet** - Quick creation
   - Smart defaults from M4.1 preferences
   - Date validation (no overlaps)
   - Custom or auto-generated naming

**Refactored View**:
- **MealPlanView → MealPlanDetailView**
  - Change from "fetch active" to "passed plan parameter"
  - Show calendar for specific plan
  - All calendar logic stays the same

### **Critical Features**

**1. Active Plan State Machine**:
```swift
Status Logic:
- Active:    startDate <= today <= endDate && !isCompleted
- Upcoming:  startDate > today && !isCompleted  
- Completed: endDate < today OR isCompleted == true

Rules:
- Only one plan active at a time
- Plan containing today = active
- Auto-transition on app launch
- Date-based, no manual management
```

**2. Date Overlap Prevention**:
- Hard block: No overlapping dates allowed
- Validation during creation/editing
- Clear error: "Dates overlap with [Plan Name]"
- Maintains data integrity

**3. One Recipe Per Day**:
- Assign recipe to date with existing recipe
- Options: Replace (with confirmation) or pick different date
- No multi-meal support (future enhancement)

**4. Recipe Usage Tracking** (CHANGED IN M4.2.4):
```swift
// OLD (M2): Track when added to grocery list
// NEW (M4.2.4): Track when added to meal plan

func addRecipeToMealPlan(recipe: Recipe, date: Date, plan: MealPlan) {
    recipe.usageCount += 1
    recipe.lastUsed = date  // Planned meal date, not today!
}

// Remove tracking from AddIngredientsToListView
```

**Rationale**: Meal plan assignment = intent to cook (better signal than grocery list)

**5. Completed Plans Management**:
- Auto-complete when end date passes
- Manual "Mark Complete" option
- Collapsible section (collapsed by default)
- Preserves historical data for analytics

### **Core Data Schema Changes**

```swift
MealPlan {
    // Existing
    id: UUID
    name: String?
    startDate: Date
    duration: Int32
    isActive: Bool
    
    // NEW - M4.2.4 Additions
    isCompleted: Bool        // Completion status
    completedDate: Date?     // When completed (auto or manual)
    
    // Relationships (existing)
    plannedMeals: [PlannedMeal]
}
```

### **Service Layer Enhancements**

```swift
MealPlanService {
    // NEW methods for M4.2.4
    func validatePlanDates(...) -> ValidationResult
    func updateActivePlanStatus(in context: NSManagedObjectContext)
    func updateCompletedStatus(in context: NSManagedObjectContext)
    func getActivePlan() -> MealPlan?
    func getUpcomingPlans() -> [MealPlan]
    func getCompletedPlans() -> [MealPlan]
    
    // UPDATED for recipe tracking
    func addRecipeToMealPlan(recipe: Recipe, date: Date, plan: MealPlan) {
        // ... create PlannedMeal
        recipe.usageCount += 1
        recipe.lastUsed = date  // Planned date
    }
}
```
