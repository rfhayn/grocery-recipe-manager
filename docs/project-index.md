**Progress Update (60 minutes completed of 90 minutes total):**

**‚úÖ 1. Smart List Selection Logic (20 minutes) - COMPLETE**
**Implementation Date**: Today  
**Status**: Successfully implemented
- Find newest uncompleted WeeklyList first using Core Data query
- If no uncompleted lists exist, prompt user: "Create new grocery list for Week of [date]?"
- Only create new list if user confirms (handle cancellation gracefully)
- Use existing "Week of [date]" naming convention from Milestone 1
- Handle edge cases: empty database, multiple uncompleted lists (use most recent)

**‚úÖ 2. Enhanced Item Display Format (15 minutes) - COMPLETE**
**Implementation Date**: Today  
**Status**: Successfully implemented
- Changed GroceryListItem display from "2 cups all-purpose flour" to "all-purpose flour" (primary) + "2 cups" (secondary)
- Item name with normal font size and readable color
- Quantity with 75% font size and muted color (.secondary)
- Maintains visual hierarchy and readability
- Handles items without quantities gracefully

**‚úÖ 3. Quantity Merging System (20 minutes) - COMPLETE**
**Implementation Date**: Today  
**Status**: Successfully implemented
- Detects existing ingredients by name matching in target WeeklyList
- Merges compatible quantities: "1 cup" + "2 cups" = "3 cups"
- Handles mixed units gracefully: "1 cup" + "2 tablespoons" = displays both separately
- Handles non-numeric quantities: "pinch" + "1 tsp" = displays both
- Updates existing GroceryListItem rather than creating duplicates
- Shows user feedback about merging: "Combined with existing [ingredient]"
