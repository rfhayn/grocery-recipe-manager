**Priority**: Critical for Milestone 2 success  
**Enhanced Timeline**: **4-5 hours** (+1 hour for critical architecture enhancements)  
**Status**: 📋 **All Prerequisites Complete** → **Enhanced Development Ready**

### **🔴 CRITICAL: Phase 0 - Architecture Enhancements** (1 hour) 
**Purpose**: Prevent performance debt and technical issues before recipe complexity  
**Priority**: IMPLEMENT FIRST - These enhancements are critical for scalable recipe functionality

#### **Performance Optimization Requirements (30 minutes)**
- **REQ-RM-ARCH-001: N+1 Query Prevention**
  - **Implementation**: Add `relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching` to Recipe fetch requests
  - **Benefit**: Recipe detail loading maintains < 0.1s response with complex ingredient relationships
  - **Code Location**: Core Data fetch request configuration in RecipesView and RecipeDetailView

- **REQ-RM-ARCH-002: Batch Relationship Fetching**
  - **Implementation**: Compound fetch requests with relationship prefetching for Recipe ↔ Ingredient ↔ GroceryItem
  - **Benefit**: Recipe catalog scales to 100+ recipes without performance degradation
  - **Pattern**: `fetchRequest.relationshipKeyPathsForPrefetching = ["ingredients", "ingredients.groceryItem"]`

#### **Data Architecture Normalization (30 minutes)**
- **REQ-RM-ARCH-003: IngredientTemplate Entity Creation**
  - **Implementation**: Create shared IngredientTemplate entity eliminating ingredient duplication
  - **Data Model Enhancement**:
    ```
    IngredientTemplate: name, category, defaultUnit, id
    RecipeIngredient: template(relationship), quantity, customUnit
    Staple: template(relationship), notes
    ```
  - **Benefit**: Normalized ingredient data, consistent categorization, reduced storage

- **REQ-RM-ARCH-004: Source Tracking System**
  - **Implementation**: Add `isFromRecipe: Bool` and `sourceType: String` to GroceryListItem
  - **Benefit**: Track list item sources (staples vs recipes vs manual) for analytics and user clarity
  - **Timeline**: 0.25 hours - simple attribute additions

- **REQ-RM-ARCH-005: Ordered Ingredient Relationships**
  - **Implementation**: Update Recipe ↔ Ingredient relationship to use `NSOrderedSet`
  - **Benefit**: Preserve ingredient order as specified by recipe author
  - **Core Data**: Change relationship from `NSSet` to `NSOrderedSet` in data model

### **Enhanced Foundation Benefits from Milestone 1** 🎯
