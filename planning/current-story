  - Staple status toggle
  - Professional iOS styling
- [ ] Add search bar with real-time filtering
- [ ] Implement category-based filtering with picker interface

### Phase 2: Add/Edit Forms (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Create `AddStapleView` with professional form design:
  - Name input field with validation
  - Category picker with predefined grocery categories
  - Staple status toggle
  - Date picker for last purchased (optional)
  - Form validation and error handling
- [ ] Build `EditStapleView` reusing form components
- [ ] Implement proper navigation between views
- [ ] Add form validation and user feedback

### Phase 3: Professional iOS Interactions (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Implement swipe-to-delete functionality
- [ ] Add context menus for quick actions
- [ ] Enable bulk selection and operations
- [ ] Add "Mark as Staple" / "Remove from Staples" bulk actions
- [ ] Implement search with category combination filtering

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Add loading states and smooth animations
- [ ] Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations thoroughly
- [ ] Verify data persistence across app launches
- [ ] Test with large datasets for performance

## Learning Focus:
- **SwiftUI Forms**: Advanced form design with validation and user experience
- **Navigation Patterns**: Professional iOS navigation between list, detail, and form views
- **User Interactions**: Swipe actions, context menus, bulk operations
- **Search & Filtering**: Real-time search with multiple filter criteria
- **Data Management**: Advanced @FetchRequest usage with predicates and sorting
- **Professional UI**: Native iOS design patterns and interaction conventions

## Technical Components to Build:

### Core Views:
- `StaplesView` - Main staples management interface
- `StapleRowView` - Individual staple item component  
- `AddStapleView` - New staple creation form
- `EditStapleView` - Existing staple editing form
- `CategoryPickerView` - Grocery category selection

### Data Management:
- Enhanced fetch requests with sorting and filtering
- Search predicates for real-time filtering
- Category management with predefined options
- Bulk operation handling

### User Experience:
- Professional iOS form design patterns
- Native navigation and presentation styles
- Intuitive search and filtering interface
- Accessibility support and VoiceOver compatibility

## Success Criteria:
- âœ… **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete staples with professional UI
- âœ… **Search & Filtering**: Real-time search with category filtering works smoothly
- âœ… **Professional Interface**: Native iOS design patterns and interactions
- âœ… **Data Persistence**: All changes save and persist between app launches
- âœ… **Performance**: Smooth operation with large datasets
- âœ… **User Experience**: Intuitive interface requiring no instruction to use

## Expected Outcomes:
After completing Story 1.3, users will have:
- **Dedicated staples management** section in the app
- **Easy staple creation** with categories and metadata
- **Quick editing** of existing staples with inline operations
- **Powerful search and filtering** for staple discovery
- **Professional iOS experience** matching native app quality
